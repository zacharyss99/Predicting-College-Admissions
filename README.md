In this problem set, I modelled the chances of high school students being admitted into Harvard and Yale. I used a 2022 dataset scraped from collegedata.com and used several predictors (test_score, sat_subjects, gpa, minority, alumni, etc). 

0. Data Exploration
1. Logistic Regression Modelling - Obtaining Beta Coefficient Values and Interpreting
2. Demonstrating disparity in certain predictors in determining admission to Harvard or Yale
3. Scaled predictors, fit full Lasso logistic regression model, and evaluated results.
4. Drew ROC curve and calculated AUC for different models
